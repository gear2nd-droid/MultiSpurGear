This is an add-in for Fusion360. By selecting multiple pitch circles, it places spur gears at the location of those pitch circles. It also automatically meshes the spur gears together.

Follow the steps below to use the add-ins.
(1) You draw multiple circles on the sketch so that the pitch circles are adjacent to each other.
(2) You execute the add-in "Multi spur gear".
(3) You select multiple pitch circles in an order that takes into account the meshing relationship.
(4) You set various parameters of the spur gear.
(5) You execute the add-in "Multi spur gear".

explanatory note
・The consideration of the meshing relationship of the later selected pitch circle is taken into account when the center-to-center distance meshes with the previously selected pitch circle.
・Multiple pitch circles with independent meshing relationships can be selected together.
・Depending on the sketch plane, the meshing relationship may not be handled properly. Please be aware of this.
