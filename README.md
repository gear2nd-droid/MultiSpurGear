# Description
This is an add-in for Autodesk® Fusion 360™. Selecting multiple pitch circles, it places spur gears at the location of those pitch circles. It also automatically meshes the spur gears together.
Pitch circles in a meshing relationship cause the spur gears to be rotated and positioned at an angle of meshing.
Whenever there is a combination of pitch circles touching each other, multiple combinations can be converted to spur gears in a single operation.
The sketch plane for drawing pitch circles is not limited to the XY plane. Pitch circles drawn on any plane can be converted.
Each spur gear is created as a separate component. Therefore, it is possible to set up motion links between spur gears.

This add-in does not collect any data. It also does not obtain any information about the pitch circle used for the conversion.
